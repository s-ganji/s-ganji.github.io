        Hello there! Welcome to my homepage. <br>

    </br>I'm Zahra Ganji, and I was born in Tehran, Iran. I have graduated Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering form Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) which is the second best engineering university in Iran. My professional fields at university were artificial intelligence and computer networks.
        I have done lots of projects during my education, some of which are available in my Github page. I am so enthusiastic about Data Science and different methods of Machine Learning, and I have had some research experiences in these fields such as my research paper in cooperation with Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI) about applying machine learning models to predict gas hydrate formation condition, which is submitted to the Journal of Energy and AI.
